## 💡 Inspiration

Heavily inspired by the chill vibes of **[studywithme.io](https://studywithme.io/aesthetic-pomodoro-timer/)**. I coded this up entirely from scratch to get some reps in and build muscle memory, tossing in a few of my own custom tweaks along the way. 🎧✌️

## Features

- 🍅 Pomodoro timer — customizable 25/5/15 cycle, alarm sounds
- 🎵 Spotify integration — paste your playlist, stays in the tab
- 🎚️ Ambient sound mixer — Rain, Forest Birds, Campfire, River Flow
- 🌆 3 background themes — City Dusk, Cozy Rain, Green Forest
- 🗒️ **Sticky Notes** — Jot down thoughts without leaving your flow
